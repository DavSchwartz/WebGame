                <h3>Thanks for Visiting Smug Bug!</h3>
                <p>
                    I've been collecting and selling invertebrates for a few years now. It started as feeders for my reptile collection, but then as my interest in the hobby grew I transitioned all my tanks to bioactive enclosures. That's how I found isopods! My knowledge and collection has been growing ever since, and I love to share what I've learned and what I've collected with all of you!
                </p>
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    We strive to provide high quality invertebrates and educate about the magnificent variety and uses that nature has to offer. All of our cultures are produced in-house from captive bred stock, cultures are not for sale until they have been in our possession for a year or more.
